A programmatic interface to the [Daymet web
services](http://daymet.ornl.gov). Allows for easy downloads of Daymet
climate data directly to your R workspace or your computer. Routines for
both single pixel data downloads and gridded (netCDF) data are provided.
Please use the below citation when using the package.

## Installation

### stable release

To install the current stable release use a CRAN repository:

``` r
install.packages("daymetr")
library("daymetr")
```

### development release

To install the development releases of the package run the following
commands:

``` r
if(!require(devtools)){install.packages("devtools")}
devtools::install_github("bluegreen-labs/daymetr")
library("daymetr")
```

Vignettes are not rendered by default, if you want to include additional
documentation please use:

``` r
if(!require(devtools)){install.packages("devtools")}
devtools::install_github("bluegreen-labs/daymetr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("daymetr")
```

## Use

### Single pixel location download

For a single site use the following format

``` r
download_daymet(site = "Oak Ridge National Laboratories",
                lat = 36.0133,
                lon = -84.2625,
                start = 1980,
                end = 2010,
                internal = TRUE)
```

| site      | site name                                                                                                                       |
| lat       | latitude of the site                                                                                                            |
| lon       | longitude of the site                                                                                                           |
| start     | start year of the time series (data start in 1980)                                                                              |
| end       | end year of the time series (current year - 2 years, use force = TRUE to override)                                              |
| internal  | logical, TRUE or FALSE, if true data is imported into R workspace otherwise it is downloaded into the current working directory |
| path      | path where to store the data when not used internally, defaults to tempdir()                                                    |
| force     | force “out of temporal range” downloads                                                                                         |
| silent    | suppress the verbose output                                                                                                     |

Batch mode uses similar parameters but you provide a comma separated
file with site names and latitude longitude which are sequentially
downloaded. The format of the comma separated file is: site name,
latitude, longitude.

``` r
download_daymet_batch(file_location = 'my_sites.csv',
                      start = 1980,
                      end = 2010,
                      internal = TRUE)
```

### Gridded data downloads

For gridded data use either download\_daymet\_tiles() for individual
tiles or download\_daymet\_ncss() for a netCDF subset which is not bound
by tile limits (but restricted to a 6GB query size).

#### *Tiled data*

``` r
download_daymet_tiles(location = c(36.0133,-84.2625),
                      tiles = NULL,
                      start = 1980,
                      end = 2012,
                      param = "ALL")
```

If only the first set of coordinates is provided the tile in which these
reside is downloaded. If your region of interest falls outside the scope
of the DAYMET data coverage a warning is issued. If both top left and
bottom right coordinates are provided all tiles covering the region of
interst are downloaded. I would caution against downloading too much
data, as file sizes do add up. So be careful how you specify your region
of interest.

#### *netCDF subset (ncss) data*

``` r
download_daymet_ncss(location = c(36.61,-85.37,33.57,-81.29),
                     start = 1980,
                     end = 1980,
                     param = "tmin")
```

Keep in mind that the bounding box is defined by the minimum (square)
bounding box in a Lambert Conformal Conic (LCC) projection as defined by
the provided geographic coordinates. In general the query area will be
larger than the requested location. For more information I refer to
[Daymet documentation](https://daymet.ornl.gov/web_services.html) on the
web service.
